# Predicting Outbound Shipping Cost

* Predictive model in python to calculate actual cost of shipping based on fetaures from 12 months of shipping data.  

# Libraries Used.

# 1.Pandas
Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
# 2.Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

-A powerful N-dimensional array object
-Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
-Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
-Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

# 3.Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

# 4.Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

# 5.Sklearn
Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
